# Credit Risk Analysis
 *Technical analysis of credit risk utilizing Python and machine learning*
 
## Overview
Evaluate credit risk using six different machine learning models.  Credit risk is an unbalanced classification problem in that the population of performing loans typically greatly outnumber the population of non-performing (delinquent) loans.  Different techniques were used to train and evaluate different models with unbalanced classes. Credit card data from LendingClub with 68k+ records were used to evaluate the following six models:
* RandomOverSampler
* SMOTE
* ClusterCentroids
* SMOTEENN
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier
* EasyEnsembleClassifier

Models were run and evaluated by looking at the balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and imbalanced classification report for each model.
